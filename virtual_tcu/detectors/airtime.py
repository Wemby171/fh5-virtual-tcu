    Empirically verified against real replay telemetry: grounded driving sits

    jump arc (gravity, sign-negative), and a landing impact spikes sharply
    positive (seen up to +195) before settling back to zero.

    Wheel slip is **not** used: in real logs it frequently reads 0 even mid-
    air, so the previous "all four wheels spinning" gate never engaged and
    the car kept shifting in flight. ``vel_y`` is a poor primary signal too —
    it flips sign across the arc (up then down) while ``accel_y`` stays
    negative throughout — so the vertical acceleration is the clean
